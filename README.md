# Questioner

Crowd-source questions for a meetup. Questioner helps the meetup organizer prioritize questions to be answered during the meetup.

The admin creates meetups on the platform, then users can post questions relative to the agenda of the meetup. Other users can upvote/ downvote the questions allowing the admin to prioritize them. Users can also post comments to the questions.
